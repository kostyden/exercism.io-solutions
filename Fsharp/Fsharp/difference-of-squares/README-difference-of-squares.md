# Difference Of Squares

Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares is 2640:

    3025 - 385 = 2640

## Hints
For this exercise the following F# features come in handy:
- The [range operator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/operators.%5B-..-%5D%5B%5Et%5D-function-%5Bfsharp%5D) allows you to succinctly create a range of values.
- [List.sumBy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/list.sumby%5B't,%5Eu%5D-function-%5Bfsharp%5D) is a condensed format to apply a function to a list and then sum the results.
